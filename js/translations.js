Every day after school, I was taken to a practice room that always smelled faintly of wood and dust. My feet dangled above the polished pedals, resting on a small stool. My gaze just cleared the black fallboard, revealing the rows of hammers like giant, orderly teeth. Compared to my small frame, the tall upright piano was a silent castle, and I was the tiny intruder destined never to conquer it. The practice material was always short, repetitive pieces—mechanical, like gum chewed until tasteless, devoid of melody or anything that could stir a ripple in my heart. “Practicing” then was just a task to be checked off—a chore unrelated to joy.<br><br>I played fast. Not out of proficiency, but out of haste. Haste to finish, haste to leave, as if moving my fingers fast enough could steal time away. The notes flattened into a taut, lifeless line under my hands, without pause or breath, like a spell recited in a rush. My teacher frowned, saying I played like I was “chasing ducks”—fingers running blindly across the keys, rhythm out of control, leaving behind a panicked flurry of sound. Looking back, it wasn’t that I didn’t understand music, but that I hadn’t found a reason to truly understand what lay beneath those black and white blocks.<br><br><strong>To me then, music had no meaning; it was just a piece of furniture that made noise.</strong>"

A grand piano stood in the corner. Later, a teacher was invited to play there—mostly pop music, soft melodies that acted like invisible spice, warming the serious space of numbers and contracts. One day, that teacher let me try. He didn’t ask for dry études, but opened a pop music book and said something that smashed a hole in my heart:<br>“If you don’t like classical, start with what sounds good to you.”<br><br>That sentence was permission to “defect”—to swim from a cold kingdom of rules to a warm sea of preference. I started playing Richard Clayderman. The melodies were clear, the harmonies gentle. Strangers in the sales office began to stop and listen. I wasn’t just “smashing” keys anymore; I felt a connection. <strong>I realized music is not just for teachers or for accuracy. It can travel through the air and land in a stranger’s silence.</strong><br><br>Years later, another turning point arrived. A classmate introduced me to Animenz, who reconstructed anime melodies with rigorous classical technique. It shattered the wall between “what I liked” and “serious skill.” Driven by a primitive desire to reproduce those sounds, I rebuilt my technique—independence, speed, control—not as homework, but as necessary weapons for expression. Technique was not armor prepared at the start, but a weapon forged in the cycle of attack and failure."

Performing in Vienna’s Golden Hall, I learned that the silence before the music begins is more powerful than applause. I realized music is not for winning, but for creating a shared experience in time and space.<br><br>Many years later, I came to New York for a master’s degree seemingly unrelated to performing arts. Yet, the memory of Juilliard surfaced. This time, I walked in not as a tourist, but as a student in the Extension Division. Sunlight hit the dark wooden floors, and the sounds of practice overlapped with my memory.<br><br>I realized that my casual visit ten years ago wasn’t the start, but a marker placed by fate. I had spent a decade walking a winding path—seeing different views, experiencing disillusionment and love—to finally return to this coordinate with a complete self.<br><br><strong>I didn’t come to be a legend, but to meet this symbol of musical perfection again—calmly, curiously, and on my own terms.</strong>"

I had a bit of cleverness and a decent short-term memory; before exams, I would stuff knowledge into my brain like a hamster hoarding food, managing to stay in the safe, gray middle of the class. But my mind never truly sank into the textbooks. To me, those words and numbers were just codes printed on glossy paper, unrelated to my life.<br><br>I resented the main subjects. They felt too abstract, like looking at the world through frosted glass, and too coercive, occupying time I wanted for fantasy and play. Fourth-grade math—geometry—broke the calm surface. Questions suddenly had “layers,” and answers no longer lay on the surface. I attacked them with my usual reckless speed, thinking only of finishing, and ended up with a mess of errors.<br><br>I remember that humid afternoon. The teacher kept a few of us behind to correct mistakes. Eventually, only I remained, accompanied by the monotonous drone of the old ceiling fan. I looked at the red crosses covering my paper, and a hot shame surged from my stomach—not grievance, but the sudden, stark realization that I really <em>didn't know</em>. Tears fell, blurring the red ink. That was the first time I felt shame in the face of learning.<br><br>My escape was online gaming. I was hooked by its precise, immediate feedback loops—every victory brought golden flashes and rising stats. That certainty of “effort equals reward” was something dry textbooks couldn’t give. I even secretly traded my allowance for game point cards, hiding them under my bed.<br><br>One day, my father found them. He didn’t rage. Instead, he did something I will never forget: he took those colorful cards and taped them, one by one, continuously across the white wall of my bedroom. Soon, the wall became a mural of evidence, a silent, striking mosaic of my “crimes.” It stood there, judging me silently every moment. That visual weight was sharper than any lecture. Years later, I understood it wasn’t punishment, but a cruel kind of mercy—he forced me to face the visible consequences of my choices."

My grades were mediocre, vanishing into the median. In eighth grade, geometry returned—complex auxiliary lines and spatial imagination. Surprisingly, facing this thorn patch where I had once fallen, I felt a vague sense of defiance alongside my fear.<br><br>After one unit test where I missed many questions, I didn't close my notebook to escape the red crosses as usual. I stared at them, and a thought struck me like lightning: <strong>Where exactly did I “die”?</strong><br><br>I picked up a red pen. I didn't just write the correct answer. Below each error, I began to “autopsy” my own thinking: Was it a misread condition? Did my logic hit a dead end? Did I fail to see the auxiliary line? Or did I never memorize the theorem? I wasn't writing for the teacher; it was a severe interrogation of my own mental gaps.<br><br>The next day, the math teacher held up my notebook in front of the class. He didn't just praise the corrections; he showed them my “autopsy report.” He said, “Look, this is what true correction means.” That moment was a revelation. I realized that the engine of progress isn't blind repetition, but precise review. From then on, my “error notebook” became a “medical record” and a “battle map.” I began to trace the source of every mistake like a detective."

I felt lifted by a gentle elevator of success—praise, envy, smooth exams. This smoothness bred a dangerous illusion: <strong>I had “mastered” learning. It was easy.</strong><br><br>The blow came at the high school entrance exam. I had dismissed a previous slip in a mock exam as an accident. In the real exam, I used a foolish strategy: rushing through the “easy” foundation questions to save time for the “hard” ones, hoping to prove my brilliance. I got lost in the maze of the difficult problems, running out of time, while the simple questions I had scorned were full of traps I had rushed into. I failed to reach the priority high school class. The “excellent self” I had built on rankings collapsed like a sandcastle.<br><br>I entered high school carrying that defeat. I became silent and cautious. In the high-pressure environment of twelfth grade, I watched classmates crumble or withdraw. I realized this long race wasn't just about knowledge, but about emotional resilience.<br><br>Before the college entrance exam (Gaokao), I made a psychological construction opposite to my middle school arrogance. I deliberately lowered my expectations. I told myself: even a second-tier university is not the end of the world. This strategic “retreat” wasn't giving up; it was unlocking the shackles of “needing to prove myself.”<br><br>My goal became clear: <strong>Secure every point I am supposed to get.</strong> I stopped coveting the flashy hard problems and worked like a patient craftsman on the foundation. The result? I scored higher than I ever had in high school, far exceeding my disastrous middle school performance, and was admitted to Sun Yat-sen University.<br><br>Looking back, my academic journey isn't a legend of genius awakening.<br><br>It is a voyage of constant <strong>“calibration.”</strong> I learned not how to always be first, but how to clear the stones I tripped over; how to spot the reefs of arrogance when sailing smoothly; and how to manage fear and greed at critical junctures.

Friendships were loose and fleeting. I was an ordinary child with a few playmates, going home separately after school. The world was light then, with no roles to play or centers to be. Days flowed smoothly in ignorance. Until an accident started by “play” quietly rewrote the trajectory.<br><br>During those years, some rythmic pop music and dance videos suddenly became popular. A few close classmates and I started awkwardly mimicking the moves after class. At first, it was just gesturing in the hallway during breaks, laughing. Later, someone brought a portable speaker. When the music first blasted in the empty classroom after school, the nature of things changed. Notes acted like magnets, drawing curious eyes and figures from all directions. The crowd grew—from three or five to a dozen; movements went from ragged to accidentally synchronized. We were no longer satisfied with the classroom; the stage spread to the echoing underground garage of residental buildings, and sometimes even daringly to the empty school restrooms, releasing restless energy in front of the mirrors.<br><br>Unknowingly, I found myself standing in the center of that circle.<br><br>A tender, primitive instinct for organization began to sprout. I assigned roles to partners, gave them nicknames, and even subconsciously mimicked guild systems from online games, setting symbolic “ranks” and “titles.” Whoever came often or danced hard got more attention and “voice” in the group. That rule set was childish and random, born of a child's imagination, yet surprisingly effective. People stayed not because of discipline, but because they were attracted by that shared liveliness and belonging.<br><br>Eventually, we “played” past the boundary. The noise and laughter penetrated floors, and it was said even the principal's desk felt the “tremor.” We were called for a talk. It ended flatly with a few warnings and no real punishment. But when I walked out of that office, my mind was clear as a mirror: Something had <strong>irrevocably</strong> changed. A seed about “gathering” had fallen into my conscious soil.<br><br>I vaguely realized for the first time: <strong>People can be attracted and condensed. And I, seemingly unintentionally, had touched that switch.</strong><br><br>In middle school, as my academic ranking climbed, this feeling of “being seen” was rapidly amplified and given a new energy field.<br><br>My presence was no longer transparent. I was given small public roles: eye exercise inspector, class meeting recorder, event materials coordinator. These positions were trivial, but they acted as special observation windows, allowing me to scrutinize the subtle reactions of the crowd from different angles.<br><br>I discovered experimentally that many things were not about authority, but presentation. Lowering or raising the voice a few degrees, slowing down or speeding up speech, or even choosing to stand slightly left or right on the podium could invisibly change the flow of air in a room. Some commands, if spoken with a more certain, distinct manner, could instantly silence the noise. When I patrolled, a deliberately designed, slightly theatrical pause and scan harvested eyes faster than any words. When other monitors wrote a neat “A+” on the blackboard, I would mischievously leave an “A√2+”—using this small math joke to highlight my expanding personal identity.<br><br>For a time, I was addicted to this almost magical sense of control.<br><br>I started to perform consciously. I mimicked impassioned speakers in my memory, deliberately training my tone, gesture amplitude, and even pause rhythm, all to maximize attention capture. The crowd's feedback was direct and hot: some followed, some imitated, some saw me as a weather vane. My name, like a stone thrown into a pond, spread rapidly in the small pond of the school, as if everyone knew it.<br><br>Now, looking back with distance, I know clearly: <strong>That was not leadership.</strong> <strong>That was more like a primitive, rough, unrefined “influence.”</strong><br><br>It was like wild fire, burning fiercely, illuminating a corner, but easily out of control, burning oneself."

The academic Waterloo was like a basin of ice water, making me clearly see a fact in the shiver: <strong>Standing in the center of the crowd does not mean controlling the overall situation; winning attention and cheers does not mean gaining sincere recognition and trust.</strong><br><br>Entering high school, I actively chose a lower profile.<br><br>This was not a sudden mutation of character, but an instinctive vigilance against “being striking.” I still joined the student union, but was willing to start as an executor and assistant, observing silently and learning quietly. I began to realize that if influence does not have a clear boundary and heavy responsibility as a base, it is like a tree without roots—the higher it grows, the easier it is to be broken by the wind, or even fall on oneself.<br><br>Later, an opportunity lay before me: someone encouraged me to run for a higher core position. It was a role I was fully capable of striving for, with a good chance of winning. But after deep thought, I refused.<br><br>The reason at the time was realistic and sober: academic pressure was like a mountain, personal energy was limited, and I didn't want to dissipate my limited inner energy in the endless performance and complex balance required to maintain a “dazzling position.” Coincidentally, I read some Taoist classics at that time, and resonated deeply with the wisdom of “The highest good is like water, water benefits all things without competing” and “Know the masculine, keep to the feminine.” I longed for a more resilient and lasting way of existence.<br><br>So, on the available paths, I did not walk into the spotlight of power, but turned to a role that seemed marginal but contained unique energy—<strong>School Event Host.</strong><br><br>Hosting seems to be just standing in front of the stage and talking. But when I truly held the microphone, I realized it was a completely different art of “influence.” I was no longer the “performer” who output views and incited emotions, but became the “architect” and “guide” of the atmosphere of the entire event. I started writing scripts seriously for every hosting, studying the background and meaning of the event in advance, and even in the extremely limited appearance time, carefully designing the transition of words, trying to build an emotional curve and memory anchor for an ordinary ceremony. My voice became steady and clear, my posture calm and reserved.<br><br>I no longer deliberately chased the focus, but miraculously never truly left it. That feeling was completely different. <strong>Influence no longer comes from external publicity and conquest, but from internal credibility and constructive ability.</strong><br><br>A key school-level honor selection became a touchstone of my philosophy. That honor was traditionally reserved practically for top students, and my academic ranking did not meet the standard. But I didn't choose to complain publicly about unfair rules or campaign for votes.<br><br>I took a quieter path: I had a frank communication with the teacher in charge in private. I wrote a letter, clearly and specifically stating the organizational work I undertook in various activities, the coordination problems I solved, and the unpaid time I invested. I didn't try hard to prove “how excellent” I was, but objectively presented: <strong>In the context of this collective operation, which links I was the gear that actively engaged.</strong><br><br>Finally, the list was announced, and my name was impressively on it.<br><br>The realization at that moment was more important than the honor itself: <strong>The deepest operation of truly effective and lasting influence often happens in silent cultivation and sincere dialogue off stage, rather than noisy declarations on stage.</strong>"

More often, my work was hidden behind the scenes: communicating, polishing plans, clearing obstacles, and ensuring smooth processes. I didn't need to stand in the center of the stage to receive applause all the time, but I knew deeply that I must become the person who can steady the helm or stand out decisively at key nodes.<br><br>Looking back, my understanding of leadership was by no means an overnight epiphany.<br><br>It is a winding road of trial, experiencing <strong>ignorant publicity, swelling loss of control, painful restraint, and sober reconstruction</strong>. What I finally learned was not how to make others obey me, but how to learn a more important judgment: <strong>When to step forward and take responsibility; when to step back and lift others; when to guard silently and let the stage itself shine.</strong><br><br>I have not lost the desire to influence others and bring about change.<br><br>I just finally understand that <strong>unrestrained, self-centered influence is ultimately a fragile burden; and guidance based on trust, cooperation, and common goals can go steady and far.</strong><br><br>When I began to try to build a team and explore various possibilities of business models after graduation, what I pictured in my heart was never a strict hierarchical authoritarian structure, nor a one-man show of personal charm. My deepest hope is to gain a precious trust from team members—trust in my judgment, trust in my arrangements, and trust that the future we rush to together is worth entrusting to each other.

Equipment calibration, procedural consistency, and result verification were not isolated tasks but embedded safeguards ensuring reliability under workload pressure. Close collaboration with clinicians highlighted how laboratory data must be both technically accurate and contextually interpretable to be clinically meaningful.",
